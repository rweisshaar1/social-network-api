# Social Network API

## Purpose:
- I wanted to show case my skills as a developer and show off my knowledge of CRUD, using MongoDB as my database.

## Instructions for Use:
- You must have Insomnia, or some sort of API tester.
- `npm i` in order to download the proper dependencies.
- Make sure the database is set up using MongoDB.
- Set up a localhost session on your machine using node or nodemon.
- Seed the data from the seeder file by doing `node seeds/`.
- In Insomnia, make the proper routes you would like to test.

## Starter-Code:
- I was given the seeder files that are in the `seeds` folder and contents by my teacher, Gary Almes.
